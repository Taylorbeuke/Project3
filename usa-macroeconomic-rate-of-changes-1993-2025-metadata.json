contains historical macroeconomic data, featuring key economic indicators in the United States. It includes important metrics such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Retail Sales, Unemployment Rate, Industrial Production, Money Supply (M2), and more. The dataset spans from 1993 to the present and includes monthly data on various economic indicators, processed to show their rate of change (either percentage or absolute difference, depending on the indicator).\n\n**provenance**\n\nThe data in this dataset is sourced from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database, hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. FRED provides access to a wide range of economic data, including key macroeconomic indicators for the United States. My work involved calculating the rate of change (ROC) for each indicator and reorganizing the data into a more usable format for analysis. For more information and access to the full database, visit FRED\u0027s website.\n\n\n**Purpose and Use for the Kaggle Community:**\n\nThis dataset is a valuable resource for data scientists, economists, and analysts interested in understanding macroeconomic trends, performing time series analysis, or building predictive models. With the rate of change included, users can quickly assess the growth or contraction in these indicators month-over-month. This dataset can be used for:\n\n- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding historical economic trends.\n-Time Series Forecasting: Building models to predict future economic conditions.\n-Macroeconomic Analysis: Analyzing the relationship between various economic indicators.\n-Machine Learning Projects: Using the data as features to predict financial or economic outcomes.\n-By utilizing this dataset, users can perform in-depth analysis on the impact of macroeconomic changes, compare the historical performance of various indicators, and experiment with different time series forecasting techniques.\n\n****Column Descriptions****\n\n*Year*: The year of the observation.\n\n*Month*: The month of the observation (1-12).\n\n*Industrial Production*: Monthly data on the total output of US factories, mines, and utilities.\n\n*Manufacturers\u0027 New Orders*: Durable Goods: Measures the value of new orders placed with manufacturers for durable goods, indicating future production activity.\n\n*Consumer Price Index (CPIAUCSL)*: A measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.\n\n*Unemployment Rate*: The percentage of the total labor force that is unemployed but actively seeking employment.\n\n*Retail Sales*: The total receipts of retail stores, indicating consumer spending and economic activity.\n\n*Producer Price Index*: Measures the average change over time in the selling prices received by domestic producers for their output.\n\n*Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE)*: A measure of the prices paid by consumers for goods and services, used in calculating inflation.\n\n*National Home Price Index*: A measure of changes in residential real estate prices across the country.\n\n*All Employees, Total Nonfarm*: The number of nonfarm payroll employees, an important indicator of the labor market.\n\n*Labor Force Participation Rate*: The percentage of the working-age population that is either employed or actively looking for work.\n\n*Federal Funds Effective Rate*: The interest rate at which depository institutions lend reserve balances to other depository institutions overnight.\n\n*Building Permits*: The number of building permits issued for residential and non-residential buildings, a leading indicator of construction activity.\n\n*Money Supply (M2)*: The total money supply, including cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near money.\n\n*Personal Income*: The total income received by individuals from all sources, including wages, investments, and government transfers.\n\n*Trade Balance*: The difference between a country\u0027s imports and exports, indicating the net trade flow.\n\n*Consumer Sentiment*: The index reflecting consumer sentiment and expectations for the future economic outlook.\n\n*Consumer Confidence*: A measure of how optimistic or pessimistic consumers are regarding their expected financial situation and the economy.\n\n**Notes on Interest Rates**\nPlease note that for the Federal Funds Effective Rate (FEDFUNDS), the dataset includes the absolute change in basis points (bps), not the rate of change. This means that the dataset reflects the direct change in the interest rate rather than the percentage change month-over-month. The change is represented in basis points, where 1 basis point equals 0.01%."}
